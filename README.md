# AI Driven Regulatory Compliance Copilot
Theme: Multi-Agent Legal Compliance for Global Enterprises
Problem: Enterprises face regulatory complexity across countries, especially in healthcare, finance, and AI laws.
Solution:

A multi-agent compliance copilot that:

- Scans company documents and policies in real-time.
- Generates compliance checklists for different jurisdictions using Gen AI.
- Suggests automated remediations with traceable steps.
- Agents collaborate like a legal team:
    - Policy Scanner Agent → flags issues
    - Legal Research Agent → cites laws
    - Remediation Agent → suggests fixes

Tech Stack:

- LLM: Groq
- Vector DB: ChromaDb
- FastAPI + Streamlit for dashboard
- Regulatory datasets: HIPAA, GDPR, SEC filings

Why It Stands Out:
Demonstrates enterprise-ready, highly scalable AI with legal reasoning—a hot area for global AI compliance startups.
